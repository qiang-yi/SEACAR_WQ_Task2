# SEACAR Water Quality Project (Task 2: FY2023-2024)

## Task 2a: Evaluating IDW and RK with Barriers

This task include:
1.	Develop Python code to create interpolation maps using RK and IDW with barriers for 6 water quality parameters in 5 waterbodies in seasons around selected storms.
2.	Develop [cross-validation algorithm](https://github.com/qiang-yi/SEACAR_WQ_Task2/blob/master/IDW_Analysis.ipynb) to compute RMSE and ME for IDW with barriers.
3.	Summarizing and comparing RMSE and ME between RK and IWD in the interpolated maps.

Outcomes:
-	[Interpolated maps by IDW](https://usf.app.box.com/folder/242904369567)
- [Interpolated maps by RK]()
- [Performance metrics]()
